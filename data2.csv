brings up such as himalayan and alborz corrosions.
2- fracture (fault): if the pressure on the sedimentary layers is such that it breaks the crust, a fault occurs. in this case, with the resulting height difference
from the failure, areas are placed higher than the surrounding areas and areas also sink, and as a result, a mountain or a valley is created.
3- rise of molten material: sometimes molten material (magma) moves from the mantle to the crust and puts pressure on it. if the molten material from the crust is a way for

how is the orientation with the clock?,"hold a normal wristwatch (analog, hand) horizontally in the palm of your hand so that the hour hand is facing the sun and the shadow of the hour hand is right under the hand. in this case, the bisector of the angle between the hour hand and the number 12 on the clock (the smaller angle, not the bigger one) indicates the south direction, and the opposite direction indicates the north direction. (figure on page 83 of the textbook)"
"in the spring and summer season, when we move the clock forward one hour, how is the orientation by the hand clock?","if the clocks are moved forward one hour in the spring, first we move the clock back one hour and then we do the orientation method; or, we calculate the half of the hour hand with the number 1 instead of the number 12."
is the sharia noon the same everywhere in iran?,"the whole country usually has the same clock. in iran, sharia noon varies by about one hour (iran is located almost between two meridians, so sharia noon in the east and west of iran is about an hour apart). the correct time of each place is the same time that it is around 12 o'clock in the afternoon. in fact, to accurately determine the geographical directions, the clock must be set so that it shows 12 o'clock at noon."
can you navigate with a digital watch?,"if you are using a digital clock, you can draw the hour hand on a piece of paper or on the floor (write a circle from 1 to 12 and draw the counter hand as well), then use the hour hand method."
how to navigate with index shadow?,"steps: 1- we place the indicator vertically in front of the sun for a length of one meter on the flat ground. 2- the shadow of the indicator falls on the ground, we carefully determine the head of the shadow. 3- we wait for about 21 minutes until the shadow moves from east to west due to the movement of the sun. then we determine the second place of the shadow. 4- we connect the two ends of the shadow with a straight line; the head of the first shadow is towards the west and the head of the second shadow is towards the east. 5 - then we stand on the line; so that our left foot is on the first shadow and our right foot is on the second shadow and the index is behind us. in this case, the opposite direction is north. (picture on page 84 of the textbook)"
"why can't you navigate at night through the sun, index shadow, hour hand?",because at night there is no light source due to the darkness.
what is used to navigate at night?,"at night, you can use the stars to navigate. of course, you must be able to see the stars. if we are in a place where we cannot see the sky, we reach the high area. at high altitudes, the stars are better seen and there are no obstacles in front of our vision."
what is it like to see stars in the desert?,"in the desert there is no obstruction to your view of the stars, but there are many stars in the sky. in the desert, you have to improve your astronomy skills so that you can correctly identify the constellations you want from among the billions of stars."
"how to navigate by means of the ""pole star""?","the pole star is a fixed star above the north pole, by which the geographical north direction is determined. the polar star shows the geographical north direction (and not the magnetic north) with a very good approximation, about (0.7) degrees of error; that is, if we stand facing it, we will be facing north. to see the pole star in the night sky, you must first find the big dipper stars or the stars of zat al-kursi."
how can you find the pole star with the help of big dipper?,"the ursa major constellation consists of seven stars that are seen in the sky in the shape of a ladle. if you consider the distance between the two stars at the edge of the bucket to be equal and multiply it by five, you will get a star that is brighter than the stars around it, this is the pole star. other names of this collection are stars, seven brothers, big bear and ladle. since the stars rotate around the axis of the pole star in the sky, the spout of the correct ladle may be seen either upside down or sideways. (figure on page 87 of the textbook)"
how can you find the pole star with the help of zat al-kursi constellation?,"the constellation of zat al-kursi is a group of five stars that can be seen in the sky in the form of english letters w or m due to its rotation around the pole star. if we continue forward from the middle star of zat al-kursi as far as the distance between the two stars shown in the figure, five times its distance, we will reach the pole star."
what is the position of the pole star relative to the stars of zat al-kursi and ursa major?,"the stars zaat al-kursi and ursa major appear to be moving around the pole star. for this reason, their place always changes; but the pole star is always located between them."
what does distance estimation mean?,distance estimation is a term used in military literature. this term means the approximate measurement of the distance or distance between two points in latitude and longitude. distance estimation in a general definition is determining the approximate distance between two points.
why should the fighter be familiar with distance estimation?,"the conditions of the battlefield require every combatant to be able to quickly shoot accurately with their weapons on the desired target or report their observations correctly to the commander as soon as possible.
to report in order to achieve this goal, one should learn to estimate the distance through the training of the eye and the power of memory with useful exercises and training and using simple and practical methods."
what is the purpose of distance estimation?,"1- it is correct to close the appropriate degree on the weapon in order to aim and shoot. this is a matter of life and death for a sniper. if he misses the target, the next target is his own.
2-providing the information report to the commander or watchman to the artillery
3- understanding the report of the commander and other comrades"
how to estimate the distance using the map?,"for this purpose, first we measure the distance between the two desired points on the map with a ruler, then we convert the obtained distance to the real distance on the ground using the map scale. by multiplying the distance on the map by the denominator of the scale, the distance between two points in nature is obtained."
how do you estimate the distance with the hundred meter unit?,"for this, we must keep the distance of 100 meters in mind with repeated exercises; so that this distance becomes the queen of the mind. to estimate the distance, we visualize a distance of one hundred meters on the ground and then determine how many of these measurements there are from where we are located to the target. it should be said that the distances of the next hundred meters seem smaller. (the picture in the middle of page 91 of the textbook)"
to what distance is used to estimate the distance of one hundredth unit?,"this method is used to estimate the distance up to a distance of 500 meters, and to determine distances of 500 to 1000 meters, a point halfway to the target is first selected, and then the distance to the target is obtained using the above method. (figure at the bottom of page 91 of the textbook)"
"under normal weather conditions, a person with healthy eyes can distinguish which features from a standing fighter at different distances?","1- at a distance of 100 meters, a person can be seen well and his face can be recognized.
2- at a distance of 200 meters, a part of individual equipment such as thermos, backpack, shovel, etc. can be seen.
3- at a distance of 300 meters, the type of clothing and weapons of the person can be seen well.
4- at a distance of 400 meters, the head can be seen separated from the body, and the movements of the hands and feet can be felt well.
6- at a distance of 500 meters, a person's head can be seen as a black spot on the body.
3- at a distance of 600 meters, the head and body can be seen in the form of a black line, the top of which is narrow and the bottom is wider. (picture on page 92 of the textbook)"
how to estimate the distance using light and sound?,"the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s and the speed of sound is 331 m/s. from the difference between the speed of light and sound, we can guess the distance between the light source and ourselves. in this way, at night, as soon as we see the lightning of the mouth of a weapon, we start counting seconds (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004...), and as soon as we hear the sound of gunshots, we stop counting and the number that we have obtained a count of seconds, we multiply by 331; our approximate distance to the weapon is given in meters. be careful when counting seconds, if you reach 1010, count again from the beginning."
"if the distance between seeing the light and hearing the sound is 3 seconds, how far is it from the source of the sound?","we multiply the number 3 by 331, which means that your distance to the target is 993 meters."
what is meant by the speed of sound? explain,the speed of sound is the speed of a sound wave at a temperature of zero degrees. the speed of sound increases with increasing temperature and decreases with decreasing air temperature. the exact speed of sound is obtained by the following relation:
is it possible to estimate the distance using light and sound during the day?,"this distance estimation method can be used during the day as well, by observing the dust from the gunshots, start counting seconds and stop counting seconds when you hear the sound of gunshots. we multiply the number of seconds by 331; estimated distance is obtained."
"how can you estimate the distance with the ""lightning to thunder"" technique?","as soon as you see lightning until you hear the sound of thunder, just count the seconds and multiply the number of seconds by 331. the resulting number indicates your distance from the location of lightning. this technique is called ""lightning to thunder"" which can keep you safe from lightning in rainy weather."

"after imposing peace on imam hassan (as) and sitting on the post of caliphate, what actions did muawiyah take in syria?","he, who was a deceitful politician, had attracted smart people like amr as, who played an important role in not being defeated in the battle of safin, by giving him money and position - he also did not comply with the items mentioned in the agreement - and by his order, he was appointed to the pulpits. and they used to slander imam ali (as) during the friday prayer."

why did imam hussain (as) go to mecca from medina after yazid came to power?,"imam hussain (a.s.) did not want to swear allegiance to yazid, he left medina with his family and relatives. the imam intended to prepare the people to oppose the oppressive and corrupt government of yazid in the shelter of god's house and by using the hajj days."
why did imam hussain (as) move to kufa?,"the people of kufa, who were aware of the prophet's departure to mecca, invited him to that city by writing many letters. the first imam did not pay attention to those letters, but at the insistence of the kufians, he sent his cousin muslim bin aqeel there. after muslim arrived in kufa, thousands of people pledged allegiance to muslim on behalf of imam hussain (as). imam also left for kufa after receiving muslim's letter."
what did yazid do after hearing the news of imam hussain's departure?,"hearing the news of kufa, yazid appointed obaidullah bin ziyad, who was a hard-hearted and bloodthirsty man, to rule there. obaidullah scared the people by creating terror and arrested muslim bin aqeel and martyred him. he then forced the people of kufa to prepare for war with the prophet's son. yazid's army prevented imam and his companions from reaching kufa and forced his caravan to stop in the hot and dry land of karbala (ninewa)."
what did yazid's troops who forced imam and his companions to stop in karbala deal with them?,"the armies of yazid, who were very numerous, surrounded imam hussain (a.s.) and his companions and started the war on the day of ashura. the imam and his companions, who considered death in the path of belief and faith to be bliss and living under the shadow of oppressors' rule, fought bravely and were martyred in the path of truth."
why was the karbala uprising and the martyrdom of imam hussain (as) necessary?,"the fact that half a century after the death of the messenger of god, a corrupt and sinful person like yazid came to power as the muslim caliph, shows that the islamic society had suffered a great deviation. only a huge movement like the karbala uprising and the martyrdom of imam hussain and his children, relatives and companions could prevent the spread of this deviation."
what goals did imam hussain (as) list for his uprising?,"in his will, imam hussain (a.s.) said about the purpose of his uprising: ""my purpose is to reform the ummah of my grandfather, the messenger of god, enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and follow the path of the messenger of god and my father, ali ibn abi talib."""
how did the goals of the karbala uprising become clear to everyone?,"after the martyrdom of her brother, hazrat zainab revealed to everyone the goals of the karbala uprising and the true face of the oppressive umayyad rule during captivity with enlightening speeches."
what effect has the karbala uprising and the ashura incident had on the people of the world?,"history proves that since then, many uprisings in the islamic world and other regions have followed the example of the ashura uprising. this uprising has left a lot of impact on the anti-oppression spirit of muslims, especially shiites."
