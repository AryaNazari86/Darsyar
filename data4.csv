brings up such as himalayan and alborz corrosions.
2- fracture (fault): if the pressure on the sedimentary layers is such that it breaks the crust, a fault occurs. in this case, with the resulting height difference
from the failure, areas are placed higher than the surrounding areas and areas also sink, and as a result, a mountain or a valley is created.
3- rise of molten material: sometimes molten material (magma) moves from the mantle to the crust and exerts pressure on it. if the molten material from the crust is a way for

b) with poles
c) landmasses ()
d) seas ()"
what is the effect of distance and proximity to oceans and seas on climate?,"dry land heats up faster than water and loses its heat faster. water stores more heat than land. for this reason, oceans and seas moderate the temperature of their adjacent areas in winter and summer and reduce the heat and cold of the areas."
why do oceans and seas moderate the temperature of their neighboring areas in winter and summer?,because land heats up faster than water and loses its heat faster. water stores more heat than land.
what is the role of warm and cold sea currents in the climate of countries?,"the passage of warm water sea currents from the side of the countries causes the cold air to decrease in winter. to the photo, the passage of water currents
cold causes severe cold on the sides."
32 what climate changes occur in the troposphere layer?,"in the stratosphere (the closest layer of the atmosphere to the earth), the higher we go above the earth's surface, the air temperature decreases, therefore, in high areas and on top of peaks, mountains and slopes, the temperature is lower than in low areas."

how to navigate with index shadow?,"steps: 1- we place the indicator vertically in front of the sun for a length of one meter on the flat ground. 2- the shadow of the indicator falls on the ground, we carefully determine the head of the shadow. 3- we wait for about 21 minutes until the shadow moves from east to west due to the movement of the sun. then we determine the second place of the shadow. 4- we connect the two ends of the shadow with a straight line; the head of the first shadow is towards the west and the head of the second shadow is towards the east. 5 - then we stand on the line; so that our left foot is on the first shadow and our right foot is on the second shadow and the index is behind us. in this case, the opposite direction is north. (picture on page 84 of the textbook)"
"why can't you navigate at night through the sun, index shadow, hour hand?",because at night there is no light source due to the darkness.
what is used to navigate at night?,"at night, you can use the stars to navigate. of course, you must be able to see the stars. if we are in a place where we cannot see the sky, we reach the high area. at high altitudes, the stars are better seen and there are no obstacles in front of our vision."

"how to navigate by means of the ""pole star""?","the pole star is a fixed star above the north pole, by which the geographical north direction is determined. the polar star shows the geographic north direction (and not the magnetic north) with a very good approximation, about (0.7) degrees of error; that is, if we stand facing it, we will be facing north. to see the pole star in the night sky, you must first find the big dipper stars or the stars of zat al-kursi."
how can you find the pole star with the help of big dipper?,"the ursa major constellation consists of seven stars that are seen in the sky in the shape of a ladle. if you consider the distance between the two stars at the edge of the bucket to be equal and multiply it by five, you will get a star that is brighter than the stars around it, this is the pole star. other names of this collection are stars, seven brothers, big bear and ladle. since the stars rotate around the axis of the pole star in the sky, the spout of the correct ladle may be seen either upside down or sideways. (figure on page 87 of the textbook)"
how can you find the pole star with the help of zat al-kursi constellation?,"the constellation of zat al-kursi is a group of five stars that can be seen in the sky in the form of english letters w or m due to its rotation around the pole star. if we continue forward from the middle star of zat al-kursi as far as the distance between the two stars shown in the figure, five times its distance, we will reach the pole star."
what is the position of the pole star relative to the stars of zat al-kursi and ursa major?,"the stars zaat al-kursi and ursa major appear to be moving around the pole star. for this reason, their place always changes; but the pole star is always located between them."
what does distance estimation mean?,distance estimation is a term used in military literature. this term means the approximate measurement of distance or distance between two points in latitude and longitude. distance estimation in a general definition is determining the approximate distance between two points.

how to estimate the distance using the map?,"for this purpose, first we measure the distance between the two desired points on the map with a ruler, then we convert the obtained distance to the real distance on the ground using the map scale. by multiplying the distance on the map by the denominator of the scale, the distance between two points in nature is obtained."
how do you estimate the distance with the hundred meter unit?,"for this, we must keep the distance of 100 meters in mind with repeated exercises; so that this distance becomes the queen of the mind. to estimate the distance, we visualize a distance of one hundred meters on the ground and then determine how many of these measurements there are from where we are located to the target. it should be said that the distances of the next hundred meters seem smaller. (the picture in the middle of page 91 of the textbook)"
to what distance is used to estimate the distance of one hundredth unit?,"this method is used to estimate the distance up to a distance of 500 meters, and to determine distances of 500 to 1000 meters, a point halfway to the target is first selected, and then the distance to the target is obtained using the above method.

how to estimate the distance using light and sound?,"the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s and the speed of sound is 331 m/s. from the difference between the speed of light and sound, we can guess the distance between the light source and ourselves. in this way, at night, as soon as we see the lightning of the mouth of a weapon, we start counting seconds (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004...), and as soon as we hear the sound of gunshots, we stop counting and the number that we have obtained a count of seconds, we multiply by 331; our approximate distance to the weapon is given in meters. be careful when counting seconds, if you reach 1010, count again from the beginning."
"if the distance between seeing the light and hearing the sound is 3 seconds, how far is it from the source of the sound?","we multiply the number 3 by 331, which means that your distance to the target is 993 meters."
what is meant by the speed of sound? explain,the speed of sound is the speed of a sound wave at a temperature of zero degrees. the speed of sound increases with increasing temperature and decreases with decreasing air temperature. the exact speed of sound is obtained by the following relation:
is it possible to estimate the distance using light and sound during the day?,"this distance estimation method can be used during the day as well, by observing the dust from the gunshots, start counting seconds and stop counting seconds when you hear the sound of gunshots. we multiply the number of seconds by 331; estimated distance is obtained."
"how can you estimate the distance with the ""lightning to thunder"" technique?","as soon as you see lightning until you hear the sound of thunder, just count the seconds and multiply the number of seconds by 331. the resulting number indicates your distance from the location of lightning. this technique is called ""lightning to thunder"" which can keep you safe from lightning in rainy weather."

24- what is orientation?,orientation is said to be the knowledge that the combatant force is able to determine geographical directions in nature in any condition and situation.
25- in what cases is orientation used?,"orientation is used in many cases. for example, when you are lost in the mountains, forest, plain or desert, knowing the geographical directions, you can reach the desired place."
26- what do muslims use for orientation?,finding qiblah for praying and religious slaughter of animals
27- why is orientation important for military forces?,"because the military forces are often placed in unknown places, they must know the geographical direction very well. although today, with devices such as a compass or gps, it is possible to determine the geographical direction easily and with great accuracy; but in the absence of these devices, it is useful to know other methods of orientation."
"28- what is ""direction""?",it is a fixed extension in nature that does not change due to the change of the person's position.
"29- what is ""orientation""?",knowing the four main directions on earth.
31- name the main directions.,"north, south, east and west"
31- name the secondary directions.,"north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west"
32- how can the rest of the directions be determined by knowing one of the directions?,"if we stand facing north, our right side is east, our left is west, and behind us is south. there is a secondary direction between both main directions; for example, the bisector of the directions north and east specifies the direction northeast (northeast)."
33- are all orientation methods the same?,"some orientation methods are specific for the day, and some are specific for the night, and some methods are used in special times when the sun and stars are not available. it should be noted that many of these methods are not completely accurate and only approximate the main directions. compass and gps should be used for accurate orientation. used"
34- how can we navigate by the sun?,the sun rises from the east in the morning and is in the middle of the sky in the south at noon and sets in the west at sunset. (figure on page 82 of the textbook)
35- at what time is the orientation by the sun completely accurate and correct?,"this article is correct only at the beginning of spring and autumn; that is, on the first day of spring and autumn, the sun rises exactly in the east and sets in the west; but at other times, the place of sunrise and sunset has a slight deviation from east and west. in summer, the sun rises and sets more north than east and west, and in winter it is more south than east and west. at the beginning of summer and winter, the place of sunrise and sunset is at least 5.23 degrees away from the exact place of east and west."
36- when is noon in the northern hemisphere?,"in the northern hemisphere, during noon, the sun is always due south and the shadows of objects facing north fall. islamic noon, or astronomical noon in your geographic location, is exactly when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. at this time, the shadow index reaches its minimum during the day and then increases again. this moment is the time of the noon call to prayer."
37- what can we do to know noon?,"to know the time of noon, you can refer to newspapers, radio news and other sources, or wait for the sound of the noon call to prayer. islamic noon is roughly halfway between sunrise and sunset."
38- how is orientation with a clock?,"hold a normal wristwatch (analog, hand) horizontally in the palm of your hand so that the hour hand is facing the sun and the shadow of the hour hand is right under the hand. in this case, the bisector of the angle between the hour hand and the number 12 on the clock (the smaller angle, not the larger one) indicates the south direction, and the opposite direction indicates the north direction. (figure on page 83 of the textbook)"
"39- in the spring and summer season, when we move the clock forward one hour, how is the orientation by the hand clock?","if the clocks are moved forward one hour in the spring, first we move the clock back one hour and then we do the orientation method; or, we calculate the half of the hour hand with the number 1 instead of the number 12."
41- is the islamic noon the same everywhere in iran?,"the whole country usually has the same clock. in iran, sharia noon varies by about one hour (iran is located almost between two meridians, so sharia noon in the east and west of iran is about an hour apart). the correct time of each place is the same time that it is around 12 o'clock in the afternoon. in fact, to accurately determine the geographical directions, the clock must be set so that it shows 12 o'clock at noon."
41- is it possible to navigate with a digital watch?,"if you are using a digital clock, you can draw the hour hand on a piece of paper or on the floor (write a circle from 1 to 12 and draw the counter hand as well), then use the hour hand method."
42- how can you navigate with the index shadow?,"steps: 1- we place the indicator vertically in front of the sun for a length of one meter on the flat ground. 2- the shadow of the indicator falls on the ground, we carefully determine the head of the shadow. 3- we wait for about 21 minutes until the shadow moves from east to west due to the movement of the sun. then we determine the second place of the shadow. 4- we connect the two ends of the shadow with a straight line; the head of the first shadow is towards the west and the head of the second shadow is towards the east. 5- then we stand on the line; so that our left foot is on the first shadow and our right foot is on the second shadow and the index is behind us. in this case, the opposite direction is north. (figure on page 84 of the textbook)"
"43- why can't you navigate at night through the sun, index shadow, clock hands?",because at night there is no light source due to the darkness.
44- what is used to navigate at night?,"at night, you can use the stars to navigate. of course, you must be able to see the stars. if we are in a place where we cannot see the sky, we reach the high area. at high altitudes, the stars are better seen and there are no obstacles in front of our vision."
45- what is it like to see the stars in the desert?,"in the desert there is no obstruction to your view of the stars, but there are many stars in the sky. in the desert, you have to improve your astronomy skills so that you can correctly identify the constellations you want from among the billions of stars."
"46- how can you navigate by ""pole star""?","the pole star is a fixed star above the north pole, by which the geographical north direction is determined. the pole star shows the geographical north direction (and not the magnetic north) with a very good approximation, about (0.7) degrees of error; that is, if we stand facing it, we will be facing north. to see the pole star in the night sky, you must first find the big dipper stars or the stars of zat al-kursi."
47- how can you find the pole star with the help of big dipper?,"the ursa major constellation consists of seven stars that are seen in the sky in the shape of a ladle. if you consider the distance between the two stars at the edge of the bucket to be equal and multiply it by five, you will get a star that is brighter than the stars around it, this is the pole star. other names of this collection are stars, seven brothers, big bear and ladle. since the stars rotate around the axis of the pole star in the sky, the spout of the correct ladle may be seen either upside down or sideways. (figure on page 87 of the textbook)"
48- how can you find the pole star with the help of zat al-kursi constellation?,"the constellation of zat al-kursi is a group of five stars that can be seen in the sky in the form of english letters w or m due to its rotation around the pole star. if we continue forward from the middle star of zat al-kursi as far as the distance between the two stars shown in the figure, five times its distance, we will reach the pole star."
49- how is the position of the pole star compared to the stars of zat al-kursi and ursa major?,"the stars zaat al-kursi and ursa major appear to be moving around the pole star. for this reason, their place always changes; but the pole star is always located between them."
51- what does distance estimation mean?,distance estimation is a term used in military literature. this term means the approximate measurement of distance or distance between two points in latitude and longitude. distance estimation in a general definition is determining the approximate distance between two points.
51- why should the fighter be familiar with distance estimation?,"the conditions of the battlefield require every combatant to be able to shoot accurately with their weapons on the intended target or to report their observations to the commander as soon as possible.
to report in order to achieve this goal, one should learn distance estimation through eye training and memory power with useful exercises and training and the use of simple and practical methods."
52- what is the purpose of distance estimation?,"1- it is correct to close the appropriate degree on the weapon in order to aim and shoot. this is a matter of life and death for a sniper. if he misses the target, the next target is his own.
2- submitting the information report to the artillery commander or observer
3- understanding the report of the commander and other comrades"
53- how to estimate the distance using the map?,"for this purpose, first we measure the distance between the two desired points on the map with a ruler, then we convert the obtained distance to the real distance on the ground using the map scale. by multiplying the distance on the map by the denominator of the scale, the distance between two points in nature is obtained."
55- what is the estimation of a match with a hundred meter unit?,"for this, we must keep the distance of 100 meters in mind with repeated exercises; so that this distance becomes the queen of the mind. to estimate the distance, we visualize a distance of one hundred meters on the ground and then determine how many of these measurements there are from where we are located to the target. it should be said that the distances of the next hundred meters seem smaller. (the picture in the middle of page 91 of the textbook)"
56- to what distance is the estimation of the hundredth unit unit used?,"this method is used to estimate the distance up to a distance of 500 meters, and to determine distances of 500 to 1000 meters, a point halfway to the target is first selected, and then the distance to the target is obtained using the above method. (figure at the bottom of page 91 of the textbook)"
"57- in normal weather conditions, a person with healthy eyes is able to distinguish which features from a standing fighter at different distances?","1- at a distance of 100 meters, a person can be seen well and his face can be recognized.

4- at a distance of 400 meters, the head can be seen separated from the body, and the movements of the hands and feet can be clearly felt.
6- at a distance of 500 meters, a person's head can be seen as a black spot on the body.
3- at a distance of 600 meters, the head and body can be seen in the form of a black line, the top of which is narrow and the bottom is wider. (picture on page 92 of the textbook)"
58- how is distance estimation done using light and sound?,"the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per second and the speed of sound is 331 meters per second. from the difference between the speed of light and sound, we can guess the distance between the light source and ourselves. in this way, at night, as soon as we see the lightning of the mouth of a weapon, we start counting the seconds (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004...), and as soon as we hear the sound of gunshots, we stop counting and the number that we have obtained by counting seconds, we multiply by 331; our approximate distance to the weapon is given in meters. pay attention when counting seconds, if you reach 1010, count again from the beginning."
"59- if the distance between seeing the light and hearing the sound is 3 seconds, what is the distance to the source of the sound?","we multiply the number 3 by 331, which means that your distance to the target is 993 meters."
61- what is meant by the speed of sound? explain,the speed of sound is the speed of a sound wave at a temperature of zero degrees. the speed of sound increases with increasing temperature and decreases with decreasing air temperature. the exact speed of sound is obtained by the following relation:
61- is it possible to estimate the distance using light and sound during the day?,"this distance estimation method can be used during the day as well, by observing the dust from the gunshots, start counting seconds and stop counting seconds when you hear the sound of gunshots. we multiply the number of seconds by 331; estimated distance is obtained."
"62- how can you estimate the distance with the ""lightning to thunder"" technique?","as soon as you see lightning until you hear the sound of thunder, just count the seconds and multiply the number of seconds by 331. the resulting number indicates your distance from the location of lightning. this technique is called ""lightning to thunder"" which can keep you safe from lightning in rainy weather."
1- what are the disadvantages of hard (military) war?,high cost - human losses of attacking and defending forces

what do xylem and phloem each do?,wood vessels carry water and minerals from the roots to the organs. phloem vessels carry the materials made in the photosynthetic organs throughout the plant.
what is the function of the root?,the root absorbs the water and minerals needed by the plant.
a) what is a dead thread?,"therefore, water and substances dissolved in it can pass through the wall of the dead web and enter the root, and then move across the root and enter the xylem vessels."
what is raw juice?,the water and minerals that flow in the wood vessels are called raw sap.
what happens to the water absorbed by plants?,not all of this water is consumed and a large part of it leaves the leaves in the form of steam.
"in plants, water rises due to what force?",the release of steam from the leaves creates a suction force in the plant. this force plays a role in the upward movement of water in the plant.

define charity and state three of its benefits.,"in the holy qur'an, god has always encouraged people to give a part of their property to the needy and has called this giving of wealth ""infaq"".
benefits of charity:
a) wealth reaches the needy.
b) the class gap between the rich and the poor is decreasing.
c) most of the sins and crimes caused by poverty are eradicated from the society.
d) people become kinder to each other and feel more responsible.
g) peace and security prevail in the society."
"allah has encouraged people to spend in the quran, mention the verse. (the verse and meaning should be preserved)","those who spend their wealth day and night in secret and openly, their reward is with their lord, and fear is upon them, and their god will grieve.
those who spend their wealth, night and day, secretly and openly, their reward is with their lord. they are neither afraid nor sad."
what does god know about the wisdom of spending?,god has expressed the wisdom of charity by distributing wealth among the poor and preventing it from being monopolized by the rich.
zakat is one of the obligatory donations. explain with an example.,"zakat basically means to be cleansed from attachments and pollutions and it is said to be a kind of charity that is given to some human assets.
these assets are in three categories:
coins: gold and silver.
livestock: camels, cows, etc
sheep, cereals: wheat, barley, dates and raisins."

"how should a person who earns money through trade, industry, agriculture or other businesses pay khums?","anyone who earns money through trade, industry, agriculture or other businesses, and at the end of the ""fiscal year"", if his property is subject to khums, he must pay khums on his property for the ""fiscal year"". 13- is it possible to buy something with money that has not been paid khums? no; you cannot buy anything with money that has not been paid khums; for example, if a house is bought with that money, praying in that house is invalid."

"one of the most recommended charity is loan, explain it and say why loan is more beneficial than charity.","lending is a mustahab charity that has been emphasized a lot. this act is so valuable that in islam ten rewards are given for giving charity and eighteen rewards for lending. of course, both actions are good and admirable; but it should be noted that islamic people are honorable people who do not want to take charity from anyone, and lending money to their society helps to preserve their reputation. on the other hand, spending money in the form of loans leads to activity and business; because the one who receives charity does not think of returning it; but the borrower must work to repay the loan amount."

what does jihad mean in arabic language and islamic culture?,jihad in arabic means effort; but there is another meaning for this word in islamic culture: armed struggle (war) with the enemies of islam. jihad in the way of god is so important in the religion of islam that it has dedicated about one hundred verses of the holy quran.
why is it that the one who engages in jihad with the enemies at the command of god is always victorious?,"the one who rises to fight with the enemies by god's command is always victorious; because if he defeats the enemy, in addition to honor and pride, god's forgiveness and great reward also await him, and if he is martyred in the war with the enemy, he will achieve a position that cannot be compared to any other position in the eyes of god. therefore, jihad in the way of god is a struggle that never fails."

an example of elementary jihad: the battle of islam with the governments of iran and rome"
what did god say in the qur'an about preparing for defense?,"and fight against them with all that i can from the strength and from the bond of al-khail.
and prepare everything in your power to deal with them, such as force and trained horses, so that by doing this you will scare the enemy of god and your enemies."

what is the basis of zoning?,zoning is purely geographical and is based on the way of thinking of a geographer and his way of working. the choice of criteria and criteria to determine the boundaries of an area depends on the goal of the geographer's study and research.
how many categories are the zoning criteria divided into?,"""natural factors"" and ""human factors"""
write the natural criteria of zoning?,"roughness, weather, vegetation, soil and the like."
the type of soil affects what factors?,"it creates areas that are distinct from each other and affects the type of vegetation and cultivation, etc."
what is an ecosystem?,"ecosystems are part of natural areas, each of which is distinguished from the others due to its vegetation and special animal life."
name the human criteria of zoning?,"population, ethnicities, religion, language, culture, type of economic activities, etc."
what is meant by district center?,every geographical area has a focus or center where the most factors of unity and homogeneity exist.
what happens as we move away from the center of a geographical area and move towards its borders? give an example.,"gradually, the homogeneity factors of that area decrease and finally, these factors disappear. for example, there is a large concentration of factories in the center of an industrial area. the more we move away from this center and the closer we get to the borders of the neighboring region, the concentration and number of workshops and factories decreases until finally in
we don't see any traces of them in the nearby area."
in which areas is it difficult to determine the exact boundaries of the areas?,"in human areas such as linguistic and ethnic areas, it is more difficult to determine the boundaries of areas than natural areas such as soil or biome areas."
what is the territory and extent of the areas?,"sometimes a district is a part of a village, a city or a province or a country, and sometimes it covers several countries and continents and has a global scale."
why can the borders of the districts be changed? give an example.,"as a result of human activities or natural factors, the specific characteristics of an area may be lost and its size may decrease or increase. for example, the migration of villagers from an area or the occurrence of a drought will reduce the size of an agricultural area or may turn that area into a non-agricultural area."
why political and administrative boundaries usually do not coincide with the boundaries of natural and human areas?,"political and administrative boundaries are determined based on human choices and decisions. in this demarcation, sometimes a climatic region, linguistic and ethnic region, etc. are placed between several provinces or even several countries."
what is meant by natural areas and what is their importance?,natural areas are spread across the globe. these areas have natural characteristics and are considered the basis of human life and activities. human societies depend on natural areas for survival.
what areas do human areas include and in what context are they formed?,"including demographic, cultural, economic areas, etc. are formed and created in the context of natural areas."
how are natural or human areas managed today? give an example.,"today, all the natural or human areas of the world are under the management of political or administrative institutions, for example, institutions such as councils, municipalities, departments, governorates, organizations and finally governments have taken over the management of these areas and they make decisions about them and apply policies."
"which areas are cities, provinces and countries?",political areas.
"why are cities, provinces and countries considered political areas?",because an organization manages them. these areas are distinguished from adjacent areas by conventional boundaries.
what causes different weather characteristics?,it causes different parts of the planet to be different from each other and climate zones are created.
what is air,"give an example. the transient and temporary state of the atmosphere in a place in a short period of time. for example, we say that the weather is sunny or cloudy today or that the weather is cold today and...
but the weather, the conditions and weather conditions of an area in a relatively long period of time. for example, let's say indonesia is a hot and humid country."

3- most climate changes occur in its lower layer, i.e. the troposphere."
why is the existence of an atmosphere one of the important features of the planet earth and separates this planet from other planets?,"because the biosphere is able to live because of the air of the globe. in addition, the air of korea affects the water of korea and the stone of korea."
what elements are involved in the causes of different climate zones?,"elements such as sunlight, temperature and pressure and precipitation and how they are distributed"
what is the most important source of energy for the earth and the main factor in the emergence of weather features in different areas of the earth?,sunlight
what weather elements does the sun's radiation affect?,"temperature, pressure, humidity and precipitation."
why is the angle of the sun's rays and the amount of its dispersion on the earth not the same?,"the tilt of the earth's axis causes the sun's rays to shine perpendicularly and close to the equator, and the angle of radiation towards the pole becomes more and more oblique. therefore, the amount of solar energy that each square centimeter of the earth receives in the tropics is much more than the amount that the polar regions absorb."
why don't all parts of the earth receive the sun's energy at the same time?,due to the tilt of the earth's axis on its transitional orbit around the sun.
what does the tilting of the earth's axis on its transitional orbit around the sun cause?,it causes that the extent of the light and dark area and the length of day and night and different seasons of the year are different in different areas and in the northern and southern hemispheres during the state and transitional movement.
which region receives the least energy from the sun?,polar regions.
"16. why do warm, temperate and cold areas appear on the surface of the earth?",due to the unequal reception of the sun's energy on the surface of the earth.
write the relationship between temperature and latitude?,"as we move from the equator to higher latitudes, the air temperature decreases. the sun's rays in the equatorial region shine perpendicularly and close to perpendicularly during the year. in this way, the tropics are a great source of heat storage and the source of warm water currents in the oceans."
why are tropical areas a great source of heat storage and the source of warm water sea currents in the oceans?,because the sun's rays in the equatorial region shine perpendicularly and close to perpendicularly during the year.
what factors affect the temperature of a place?,"latitude, height above the earth's surface (on average, for every 1000 meters, 6 degrees celsius decrease in temperature in the stratosphere), distance and proximity to oceans and seas, the passage of warm and cold sea currents, and direction and object of roughness"
why does air exert pressure on everything?,because it has weight.
how is air pressure measured and what is its unit?,"it is measured by a barometer and its unit of measurement is ""hectopascal""."
what is the air pressure in a place?,it is variable and increases or decreases.
how does a low pressure center (cyclone) form over a warm area?,"when the air in an area is heated, the molecules move faster and move apart, resulting in a decrease in the weight and pressure of the air per unit volume. warm air becomes lighter and rises to the top. therefore:
warm air has less pressure than its surroundings, and as a result, a low pressure center (cyclone) is created over the warm area. in low pressure (cyclone): air pressure decreases towards the center of the area"
24 how is a high pressure center (anticyclone) formed over a cold region?,"when air cools, its molecules are closer together and their number per unit volume increases. the cold air is heavy and descends to the bottom or the surface of the earth, resulting in the formation of a high pressure center (cyclone) over the cold region. in a high pressure (cyclone), the air pressure increases towards the center of the area."
how is wind created?,"air always flows from a place of higher pressure to a place of lower pressure, thus creating wind. in other words, warm and light air rises and relatively cold and heavy air goes under it and replaces it."
what is an air mass?,"a large volume of air that has the same characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity on a horizontal surface for hundreds of kilometers is called an air mass. for example, hot and humid air mass, cold and dry air mass."
what is the air front?,fronts are the boundary between two adjacent air masses and separate them.
what happens when two different air masses are close to each other in the same area and collide?,a transition zone or change in terms of temperature or pressure occurs at their boundaries.
a transition zone or change in terms of temperature or pressure occurs in the boundaries of how?,when two different air masses are adjacent to each other in the same area and collide.
what does the collision of air masses with each other cause?,"it causes instability of the air and if it has moisture, it causes rain."

what is the result of general air circulation and climate changes in the regions?,distribution of pressure centers on the planet.
035 why are low pressure and high pressure centers formed in the equatorial and arctic regions?,"in the equatorial region, due to the direct angle of radiation and constant heat, a low pressure center is created. the poles, on the contrary, are high pressure centers due to the extreme coldness of the air."
what is the cause of rain in the tropics?,"in the tropical region, warm air rises and cools as it rises and drops its moisture in the form of rain. in the tropics, heavy rains and thunderstorms are observed every evening."
what path does the cooled air take in the upper regions of the equator?,it moves to higher latitudes and is deflected under the influence of the coriolis force. it becomes cold and heavy in the equatorial zone (around the orbit of the tropic of cancer and the tropic of god) and sinks and creates the high pressure centers of the tropic of cancer.
write the climate changes around 60 degrees latitude?,"again, due to the rising air, a low pressure area is created. this area is affected by the air mass that moves from the pole side and pushes relatively warmer air upwards. of course, due to the vastness of the land in the northern hemisphere and the vastness of the waters in the southern hemisphere, there are changes in the pressure of the regions in this region."
what causes the movement of air masses between pressure belts?,it causes different winds to blow on the surface of the earth and weather changes.
what is the state of precipitation in the world?,"the distribution of precipitation in the world is uneven. while some regions of the world, such as the tropical regions and monsoon asia, are very rainy and have more than 1500 mm of rainfall per year, some interior regions of the continents and deserts have a negligible amount of rainfall and the rainfall in them is less than 50 or 100 mm per year and it may not even rain in these areas for years."
name and explain 42 types of precipitation?,"1- convective precipitation: in this type of precipitation, the air mass becomes hotter than the surrounding air, along with rising, its temperature decreases and clouds form and precipitation occurs. spring rains are more of this type.
2- frontal (cyclonic) rainfall: this type of rainfall mostly occurs at fronts where air masses collide with each other.
3- mountain rainfall (unevenness): in this type of rainfall, mountainous areas and mountains, due to their shape and direction, prevent the mass of moist air from moving horizontally. as a result, the mass of air rises along the slope of the mountain towards the peak, and when it rises, its temperature decreases and it can no longer hold moisture in itself, and therefore, it causes precipitation."
43. what will happen if one of the two factors of humidity or the rise of moist air does not form in an area?,no precipitation occurs.
how have climatologists investigated and divided the climatic regions of the world?,using different criteria.
"what are the bases of ""coupon"" classification?","this classification is based on three criteria: precipitation, temperature and vegetation."

what areas are deserts?,areas that are deprived of one or two factors that cause precipitation.
write the causes of deserts?,"1- establishing a high pressure center near the equator
2- away from sources of moisture and shape and direction of unevenness"
how does the establishment of high-pressure seas near the tropics cause desertification?,"in high pressure areas, air subsidence prevents air ascent and, as a result, precipitation. in the subtropical region, air masses settle around the orbits of the tropic of cancer and the tropic of cancer and create a high pressure region. as a result, the earth's desert belt has spread around these two orbits in three continents. in the polar regions, due to high pressure, it is not possible for air to rise."
"what is the reason for the emergence of the desert (atacama desert in south america and namib in africa) on some coasts of the continents, such as the coasts of south america and the coasts of south africa?","in these areas, the main reason for the creation of deserts is the presence of a high pressure center and the non-ascension of air. although the cold water currents moving from the pole towards these areas intensify and strengthen the non-ascent of the air and cause desertification of these areas."
how does being away from sources of moisture and the shape and direction of unevenness cause desertification?,"give an example. some areas face dry weather due to being far from the seas and moisture sources, as well as being located behind the mountains, which prevents the mass of moist air from reaching them, such as the gobi desert or takle makan."
"why is it that there is a lot of humidity in the southern coasts of iran due to the evaporation of sea water, but there is little rainfall and these areas are considered dry areas?","there is enough humidity in the south coast of iran, but due to being located near the tropic of cancer orbit (subtropical high pressure), there is no possibility of air rising and as a result precipitation."

how much land do the plains cover?,less than a third
what factors cause the emergence and formation of unevenness on the surface of the earth?,internal factors and external factors
how do internal factors cause the appearance and formation of unevenness on the surface of the earth?,"the earth's crust is divided into large pieces. these sheets (crust and upper mantle) move slowly on the doughy part of the mantle. sheets move away from each other or close together, collide or slide along each other. the results of the movement of these plates over millions of years are the creation of folds, mountain ranges, breaks (faults) and the emergence of volcanic mountains."

what is chemical weathering? give an example.,"in chemical weathering, the structure of minerals and the chemical composition of rocks also change. for example, oxygen in the air causes the oxidation of some minerals such as iron, or gases such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide in the air can turn into acid and produce acid rain, which causes chemical changes in rocks."
what are the important factors of chemical weathering?,oxygen and moisture.
what is bioweathering?,"the activities of living organisms, i.e. plants and animals, cause physical and chemical changes in rocks, for example, the growth of tree roots or the creation of underground cavities by burrowing animals, such as mice and termites, cause rocks to crumble. to be also, decaying plants produce acids that cause chemical changes in nearby rocks. decomposing bacteria or plant respiration also cause chemical changes in rocks."
what factors does the rate of weathering in rocks depend on? give an example.,"it depends on the type of stones, weather and time. for example, granite stones are more resistant than marble or calcite stones, and hot and humid weather increases the speed and intensity of weathering."

5- man"
how do rivers cause erosion?,"rivers are constantly moving on the surface of the earth. they separate small and large particles from their bed and sides and transfer them to other places. these materials are piled up in places where the speed of the river slows down. as a result of overflowing rivers and floods, a huge amount of sediments are spread from place to place in the surrounding lands."
what is a refrigerator and how do they cause erosion?,"glaciers are large masses of ice that have been formed as a result of the accumulation and compression of snow over thousands of years in polar or very cold areas, and they move slowly from high areas to lower areas due to the force of gravity. glaciers move rocks along their path and take them with them."
how do winds cause erosion?,"the wind, especially in deserts, blows materials such as soil, sand and gravel from the ground and carries them to long distances. winds knock sand particles to different surfaces of rocks and wear them."
how do sea waves cause erosion?,"coastal areas are known to be subject to the invasion and erosion of sea waves. in times when the sea is stormy, sometimes the rocks and shores are faced with the weight of several tons of water. the sea currents of the oceans also carry sediments and deposit them in different places."
how do humans cause erosion?,"human activities in the exploitation of the natural environment cause the change of the earth's crust and digging and transporting and moving stones and soils in different places, for example, digging mines and tunnels, building roads, building dams and diverting the course of the rivers, plowing the land and destroying the vegetation create many changes in the earth's crust."
how do plate tectonic activities create mountains?,"through the creation of folds, faults or the rise of molten materials and the formation of volcanoes."

what do rivers gradually change?,they make their bed wide and deep.
how are v valleys formed and why are they named with letters?,"v-shaped valleys are usually formed by the flow of river water and water erosion, and the reason why they are named with the letter v is because they have narrow and steep slopes."
how do valleys change over time?,the valleys gradually become deeper and wider.
how does a mountain glacier appear?,"in some mountains there is permanent snow and ice. when the snowfall is more than the amount of melting in a year, the extra snow accumulates and condenses over many years, and their thickness increases and creates glaciers."
when does the mountain glacier start to move?,"usually, when its thickness reaches 60 to 100 meters, it starts to move, and this movement is from 1 cm to 8 meters per day, depending on the conditions and air temperature."
what is moraine?,"the rocks and sediments carried by the glaciers are called ""moraine or frozen ice""."
how are u-shaped valleys formed?,they are usually formed by glacial erosion over thousands of years.
how do dissolution erosion or karst forms occur?,"in some mountainous areas where stones have the ability to dissolve in water, such as limestone or chalk and the like, flowing water penetrates into the underground through seams and cracks and dissolves the stones in itself, phenomena erosion creates natural caves and limestone springs, which are called karstic formations."
what is karst?,"""karst"" is the phenomenon of corrosion and dissolution of limestone."
how can water cause corrosion and dissolution of stones?,waters that combine with carbon dioxide and air produce carbonic acid and can cause corrosion and dissolution of rocks by dissolving lime and gypsum.
name examples of karst forms in iran?,"in iran, there are many karst forms, especially in the zagros mountains. ali sadr caves in hamadan and katlekhor zanjan caves are examples of karst erosion structures."
what is the important factor of erosion in dry and desert areas?,the wind

how is a sandy plain (vein) formed and what is its other name?,"when the wind takes the fine sand with it in the lands covered with fine sand, sand and fine and coarse stones, over time, the coarse stones remain and create surfaces full of rubble. which is also called desert pavement."
how are wind holes formed?,"in areas with fine sand, and especially without vegetation, the wind moves the particles from their place and gradually creates large holes or pits. if, due to contact with underground water, moisture and adhesion occurs in the seeds, wind erosion slows down and then stops. there are wind holes, some of which are 40 meters deep, in the lot plain."
how does klot (yardang) come about?,"over millions of years, wind creates parallel, u-shaped grooves in the soft sediments left over from ancient lakes. it gradually takes the soft part with it and the harder parts remain."

what are clots?,wind erosion is blue.
in which countries are clods seen?,"they are found in dry areas of the united states of america, egypt, china and iran."
how are the demon's mace and stone pillars formed?,"sometimes the wind destroys the soft materials that are placed under or on the edge of the boulders and takes them with it, leaving the hard and resistant parts. as a result, stone columns in the shape of mushrooms or other shapes are formed, which are called devil's wands: gen's chimney, (hodoo in english) and..."
how are compact forms formed?,this erosion is the result of accumulation of particles by the wind in one place.
name the dense forms of the desert?,sand dunes (dunes).
how are sand dunes formed?,"sand dunes or dunes, which are known as dune in english, are formed by the wind and the movement of sand and gravel, the sand that moves on the surface of the earth by the wind, if there are obstacles such as plants. and thorn bushes or pieces of stone and the like collide and stop or the wind speed in the area decreases, they pile up and finally form dunes."
how high are the sand dunes?,"they are several meters high, and the height of some sand dunes in libya reaches up to 300 meters and in lut, iran, up to 400 meters."
what is the movement of dunes or sand dunes during a year?,some dunes move 10 to 20 meters in the direction of the wind in a year.

how many parts does each ecosystem consist of?,"1- living sector: producers (plants),
first category consumers (vegetarians),
second category consumers (meat eaters),
decomposers (bacteria, etc.)
2- inanimate: rock, soil, water and air, etc."
what are the only living organisms that produce in an ecosystem?,plants.
why are plants the only productive organisms in an ecosystem?,"because they can make food through photosynthesis, and in this way, the life of other living organisms depends on them."
what does the ecosystem consist of?,it consists of a number of ecosystems and has a large area.
what is biome?,"ecosystems are large geographical areas in which specific and similar types of plants and animals live, and for this reason, they create an area that is distinguished from other areas, such as the tundra biome or the forest biome. tropical rain"
why does the ecosystem create an area?,because there are vast geographical areas where special and similar types of plants and animals live.
the type of each biome and its characteristics depend on what factors?,"geographical location, weather conditions (temperature, evaporation, precipitation), the shape of the unevenness and the height from the surface of the earth and the type of soils."
why have diverse ecosystems emerged?,because the characteristics and factors that make up an ecosystem on the surface of the earth are not the same and different
the study of ecosystems is one of the subjects of which field of geography?,biogeography.
how have biogeographers divided ecosystems?,"in general, there is no agreement among biogeographers on the number of biomes and their division. some have divided biomes into two general categories of land biomes and marine biomes, and some have even presented up to 16 land biomes and 5 marine biomes in their classification."
"what factors did whittaker, a biogeographer, pay attention to in his famous classification for the ecosystem?",he paid attention to the two factors of precipitation and temperature.
"according to s.a. goudie's classification, biomes are divided into how many classes?",eight biomes.
"what changes in the type and density of vegetation occur by moving from the equatorial orbit to the orbit of the tropic of cancer, the tropic of cancer, and the polar region?","in the equatorial orbit due to high temperature and sufficient humidity (a lot of rain) there is a possibility of abundant growth of plants followed by diverse animal life, and we move away from the equator around the orbits of ras karkar and ras al jadi due to the decrease in rainfall and dryness of the air. the diversity of flora and fauna of biomes is reduced, and in the polar circle, biodiversity is minimized due to the extreme decrease in temperature and humidity and snow and ice cover."
which biome has the densest vegetation?,the ecosystem of tropical rainforests due to the presence of sufficient humidity and temperature and its uniformity throughout the year and abundant rainfall.
in which ecosystems is the poorest vegetation found? why,"in the desert due to very high temperature (high temperature fluctuation), low rainfall, high dryness of the air throughout the year and strong evaporation. and the polar ecosystem due to extreme cold and low sunlight"
what is the difference between trees in temperate and taiga forests? why,"the forests of temperate regions are deciduous and broad-leaved forests and taiga forests are seen in the form of coniferous and coniferous trees such as cypress and pine. because the temperate regions with moderate climate and relatively high rainfall are suitable for the growth of broadleaf forests, but the taiga region is suitable for coniferous forests due to the cold climate and low temperature and rainfall in the hot season."
18 do all ecosystems exist on all continents? explain,"no, due to latitude, sunlight and rainfall, only some of these biomes may be found on each continent."
"in new methods, what criteria do they use to distinguish ecosystems?","1- the amount of organic moon production

what is national power?,the power of a nation or country is to achieve its goals and achieve its ideals.
what is the result if a country has a lot of national power?,it can fulfill the goals and desires of its nation without hindrance.
what is the most important factor in the production of national power?,geographic factors.
how many groups are the geographical factors of the car in the national power?,"1- geographical location of the country
2- the size, shape and unevenness of the country
3- biological foundations of the country
4- energy and mineral resources of the country
5- the population of the country."
what is geographic location (mathematical and relative)?,it is how a place is located on the surface of the earth.
write the effect of geographical location on the power of a country?,"geographical location has a significant impact on increasing or decreasing the power of a country. for example, the location of a country among its strong or weak neighbors has an impact on the country's foreign policy."
what do buffer countries mean? give an example.,"that is, the countries that are located between two or more great powers usually find a vulnerable position, such as poland, which is located between russia and germany and has lost its existence in periods of history due to this position."
what does maritime position mean?,it means access to open water.
33. write the effect of the maritime situation on the national power?,"maritime position plays an important role in the national power of a country. access to open waters or not having access to the sea also affects the strength or weakness of a country. for example, england and japan have access to open waters from all sides and have been able to become great maritime powers."
explain the role of breadth in national power?,"large size in itself is a good thing, and among two countries that have the same conditions, the country that has a larger land is more powerful. small countries that lack space face problems for their activities. also, in large countries during the war, the supporting military forces can be transferred to another part, as in the war between japan and china, china transferred its forces and supplies to the west of its country."
what effect does the quality of the land and the type of roughness have on effective national power?,"flat lands are very suitable for agriculture and the development of road and transportation networks. mountain areas, vast deserts, swamps and deserts require a lot of money and investment for economic and communication activities and face many problems. of course, mountainous areas play a positive role in terms of defense."
name the types of shapes of countries?,"1- compact countries have a shape similar to a square or a circle
2- long countries are countries whose length is at least six times their width
3- comet countries have a peninsular or corridor-like part that is separated from the mainland
4- multi-part countries are island countries.
5- enclosed countries are countries that are surrounded by another country."
what is the best shape for a country?,it is a compact form in which the capital is placed in the center.
why is the best shape for a country compact?,"in such a situation, it is possible to reach all parts of a land from the center in the least amount of time. the defense capability of the country is high in this form."
write the problems of long and multi-piece countries?,the government's supervision of all parts of the country and also the creation of communication lines face problems.
what factors are considered the biological foundations of the country?,"water, soil, climate and vegetation."
why is water one of the main problems and one of the factors of competition and conflict between countries in the future of the world?,"because due to population growth and changing life patterns, consumption"
what are the problems faced by the countries that are suffering from water shortages or soil erosion?,"their capabilities become weak and not only the possibility of producing raw materials and agricultural products and feeding the population in them decreases, but also their dependence on imports increases."
explain the effect of weather on the national power of a country?,"weather also plays an important role in agriculture and food production and other economic and life activities. usually, it is more possible to transform the countries located in the temperate zone into regional or global political powers, and it is unlikely that a great political power can be formed in very cold and freezing lands or hot and burning deserts. ."
how is the country's energy and mineral resources a factor in increasing or decreasing the national power of a country?,"energy and mineral resources such as oil and gas, metal minerals such as copper, zinc and iron are used in industry and military affairs. having these resources alone is not the source of value. if these resources are located in a country for the development of industries (such as china and brazil), they are effective in the power of that country, but if the country's economy is dependent on their export, they are considered a negative feature and a factor in reducing national power."
why is having a large population a factor of national power?,"because it is both a source of work and wealth production, a military and defense force, and a source of national spirit"
what is the prerequisite for the power of a country?,large crowd

b- nicolaus copernicus' heliocentric theory"
explain the central earth theory.,"ptolemy, a greek scientist more than two thousand years ago, after observing the apparent movement of the moon and the sun, concluded that the earth is at the center of the universe and other heavenly bodies revolve around it. according to this theory, which was named the ""central earth"" theory, the earth is fixed, and the moon, the sun, and the five known planets of that time, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and saturn, revolve around the earth in circular orbits. ."
who were the opponents of the central earth theory?,"some iranian scientists, such as abu saeed sajzai and khwaja nasir al-din tusi, made objections to the theory of the central earth with accurate measurements and correct interpretation of scientific findings. this theory also had opponents in europe; but it was mentioned until around the 16th century."
the central sun theory was proposed by which scientist?,copernicus
write the basis of copernicus heliocentric theory.,"- the earth, along with the moon, revolves around the sun in a circular orbit like other planets.
- the daily movement of the sun in the sky is the appearance and result of the earth's rotation around its axis."
which scientist noticed that the motion of the planets around the sun is elliptical?,kepler
write kepler's three laws.,first law: every planet moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit in such a way that the sun is always in one of its two foci.
"the distance of a planet from the earth is 9 astronomical units. according to kepler's third law, how many years does it take for this planet to completely rotate around the sun?","we get the power of 3 number 9, which becomes 729, and then we get its tide, which becomes 27, which means that this planet goes around the sun once every 27 years.
729=9x9x9
√729=27"
the distance between pluto and the sun is 44.39 astronomical units. calculate the duration of one revolution of this planet around the sun.,"61304=39.44×39.44×39.44
248 years=61304 √"
"the period of rotation of a planet around the sun is 27 years. according to kepler's second law, how many astronomical units is the distance of this planet from the sun?","first, we turn on the shift key of the engineering calculator. we get the root of the number 27, which becomes 729, and then with an engineering calculator, we get the third root of the number 729, which becomes 9. the distance of this planet is 9 astronomical units.
729=27x27
9=7293√3"
write the stages of formation and beginning of life on earth.,"about six billion years ago, with the first accumulations of cosmic particles, the formation of the solar system began, and about 6.4 billion years ago, the planet earth was formed as a molten sphere and placed in its orbit. with the passage of time and the cooling of this molten sphere, about four billion years ago, igneous rocks were formed as the first components of the earth's rock; then, with the eruption of numerous volcanoes, various gases such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc. gradually came out of the earth and created the air of the globe. in different eras, climate and environmental conditions have changed a lot, and based on this, different species of living things have appeared and become extinct on the surface of the earth. for example, reptiles appeared in the early carboniferous period, and within 70-80 million years, they grew in size and spread across the globe. due to unfavorable environmental conditions and dinosaurs' inability to adapt to environmental changes, these creatures became extinct about 65 million years ago."
what is the importance of identifying stones?,"determining the age of rocks and various phenomena is very important in terms of examining the history of the earth, exploring the reserves and resources available on the earth, predicting possible future events, etc."
write two methods of identifying stones.,"in geology, the age of rocks and phenomena is determined by two methods: relative and absolute age."
what is the difference between relative age and absolute age?,"in determining the relative age, the sequence of occurrence of phenomena is determined relative to each other
determining the absolute age (radiometry) the real age of phenomena is measured using radioactive elements
to be"
what is the half life of an element?,radioactive elements are constantly decaying at a constant rate. these elements become stable elements after decay. the time it takes for half of a radioactive element to turn into a stable element is called the half-life of that element.
explain the method of determining absolute age.,"in determining the absolute age using the following relationship, the exact time of occurrence of the phenomenon is determined.
half-life length × number of half-lives = age of the phenomenon"
name the different time scales.,"the concept of time is used in different scales. the basic unit of time is the second. you are familiar with larger units of time such as: minute, hour, night, day, week, month, year, decade, century and millennium; but, there are also larger units of time that are not very useful in our daily life, such as era, period, era and eon, which are time units used in geology."
what factors does the criterion for dividing larger units of time depend on?,"the criteria for dividing these different time units depends on important events such as the appearance or extinction of certain species of organisms, orogeny events, global advance or retreat of the seas, etc."

describe the expansion stage of the wilson cycle.,"at this stage, the created gap expands and seas are formed in the place of the created pits, such as the red sea - atlantic ocean."
explain the closing stage of the wilson cycle.,"in one or more regions of the created ocean, the oceanic crust subducts and the ocean becomes smaller and eventually closes."
explain the collision phase of the wilson cycle.,"with the closing of the ocean and the collision of plates, ocean sediments, mountain ranges are formed, such as the himalayas, alborz, zagros."
what are the causes of seasons and three climate zones on earth?,"a - earth's axis with a line perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the sun, an angle of about 23.5 degrees
makes and during the rotation around the sun, the direction of the axis is almost constant and unchanged.
b- on the other hand, the earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical and the distance from the earth to the sun changes in a year.
therefore, during six months of the year, the northern hemisphere and during the other six months of the southern hemisphere, the earth is more exposed to the sun's radiation."

day and night are equal in which regions of the earth?,"on the first of july in the northern polar orbit and on the first of january in the orbit of ras al-jadi, the sun can be seen in the sky for 24 hours, which is called the midnight sun."
"on the 1st of april, the sun shines on the zero degree orbit (equator) and after 93 days on the 5.23 degree north orbit (cancer's orbit), and it is the first of july and the beginning of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere!! on which perpendicular orbit does the sun shine on may 12?","there is a difference of 5.23 degrees between the equator and the orbit of the tropic of cancer. the sun travels this 5.23 degrees in 93 days to reach the orbit of the tropic of cancer. now you have to see the ratio. from the first of april to the 12th of may, there are 43 days. we calculate 23 degrees, 93 days, 43 days. how many degrees is 43 multiplied by 23 degrees divided by 93? 10 degrees north, the sun is located at 10 degrees north latitude on 12 may."
explain the role of mineral resources in human life today.,"most of the materials needed for our life are provided from mineral sources. copper in electric cables, iron used in railway rails, platinum in mobile phones, the pencil we use to write with, the toothpaste we use to brush our teeth, etc., are obtained from mineral resources. mineral resources after identification by geologists, from mining mines and after processing, they become needed goods. a number of applications of minerals (metallic - non-metallic) are given in the table."
what is clark's concentration?,"in 1964 ad, two geologists named clark and ringwood, to determine the chemical composition of the earth's crust and investigate the distribution of elements in its different parts, sampled a large number of different types of rocks from different regions and determined their chemical composition. today, the average chemical composition of the earth's crust is known as the clark concentration of elements."
what is the application of the average concentration of elements? explain,"the average concentration of elements has many applications. by measuring the amount of concentration of elements in the rocks and soils of each region and comparing it with the average concentration values, the researchers find out about the geological processes such as the movement of the plates of the earth, the history of the formation of a region, etc."
what is the concept of positive and negative anomaly in clark's concentration? explain,"if in a region, the concentration of elements is higher than clark's average, it is called a positive anomaly, and if their concentration is lower than the average, it is called a negative anomaly. geologists search for areas with positive anomalies in exploration."
name the types of minerals.,"minerals are classified into two groups, silicates and non-silicates, based on their chemical composition."
define silicate.,"silicates are minerals that make up 96% of the earth's crust and have a silicate base (sio4^−4) in their chemical composition.
silicate minerals are found in igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic rocks."
what are non-silicate minerals?,non-silicate minerals are a group of minerals that do not have a silicate base in their composition. these minerals are also found in all kinds of rocks.
define ore.,"a group of minerals in which there is an economically valuable metal is referred to as an ore. like magnetite from which iron is extracted or galena from which lead is extracted. some minerals are found in free form such as gold, silver and copper"
two parts of ore or ore (definition of ore and tailings),"ore or ore consists of two parts, ore and tailings. ore is the valuable part of the ore, and tailings are materials that do not have significant economic value."
name the most important copper ore.,"for example, chalcopyrite, with the chemical formula cufes2, is the most important ore of copper metal. in copper mines, this mineral along with various waste minerals such as quartz, feldspar, mica, clay minerals, pyrite, etc.
form copper ore."
define deposit.,"in parts of the earth's crust, the concentration of elements in a region increases compared to the average concentration. and a large amount of mineral matter is concentrated there (positive anomaly), so that its extraction is economically viable, and these areas are called deposits."
what is a mine and how is it formed?,extraction of mineral or ore is often expensive and exploitation begins only if there is an element with sufficient volume and concentration in the mineral. a mine is formed when exploitation or mining begins.
explain the definition of industrial rocks and minerals and their importance.,"in addition to minerals, other minerals are also extracted for industrial or daily use, which are not metallic.
such as: sand in construction, clay in making bricks or ceramic tiles, building stones are used in facades of buildings, flooring, stairs and walls. these types of non-metallic stones and minerals are called industrial stones and minerals.
in some cases, the non-economic part or tailings of an ore is used as sand in the construction of roads."
name the types of ore.,"based on the way of formation, ores are divided into three categories: magmatic, hydrothermal and sedimentary."
"write the formation of magmatic ores such as chromium, nickel and platinum.","the ores of some metallic elements such as chromium, nickel and platinum can be formed from a cooling magma. as a magma cools and crystallizes, these elements, which have a relatively high density, settle in the lower part of the magma and make these ores."
write how pegmatite is formed and its importance.,"if, after the crystallization of most of the magma, the amount of water and volatile substances such as carbon dioxide, etc. is abundant, the conditions for the growth of rock-forming crystals are provided and rocks with very large crystals, called pegmatite, are formed. which can be an important deposit for some special elements such as lithium and some gem minerals such as emerald or industrial minerals such as muscovite."
what is the geothermal slope?,"in the earth's crust, for every 100 meters of depth increase, the temperature increases by 3 degrees celsius. to this
temperature changes in the earth's crust are called geothermal gradient."
write how mineral veins are formed by hot water.,"in the deep parts of the crust, due to the heat caused by the geothermal slope or molten masses, the temperature of the water in these areas increases and causes the dissolution of some elements. these waters deposit some elements in the form of ore inside the rock fractures and make mineral veins."
what are hydrothermal ores?,"since the formation factor of these ores is hot water, they are called hydrothermal ores."
which mineral deposits are of hydrothermal origin?,"many deposits of copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tin and some other metals are of hydrothermal origin."
name the most important sedimentary ores.,"lead and zinc deposits in limestone, copper in shales and sandstones, and uranium in sandstones are examples of important sedimentary ores."
describe the formation of placer deposits.,"in the first stage of exploration, geologists identify areas where mineral deposits are likely to be formed by examining geological maps and field visits. for example, geologists know that some lead deposits are found in limestone."
write the methods of identifying mineral deposits.,"therefore, by knowing the physical characteristics of ores, such as magnetic properties of ores, electrical conductivity of rocks, changes in the earth's gravity field, etc., they identify subsurface and hidden deposits by geophysical methods."
how is the drilling and testing of drilling samples done? explain,"after determining the approximate location of a mineral mass underground, drilling with advanced devices and
sampling is done from the depth to the extent that there is mineral matter. these excavations may continue for hundreds of meters. the samples prepared from drilling are transported to the laboratory to determine the grade of the metal or the quality of the mineral and identify the minerals in them, where they are examined by a microscope or chemical analysis devices.
finally, geologists or exploration engineers, all the data obtained with software
they analyze and determine the amount of mineral reserves and the average grade of the mineral"
when is the extraction of mineral resources done?,"after the end of the exploration operation, with the economic determination of the reserves, the extraction operation begins."
how is the extraction method determined?,the extraction method is determined based on the shape and placement of the mineral mass in the shell.
write the types of mining.,mining is done by open and underground methods.
write the characteristics of copper deposit.,"as mentioned, in the ore extracted from the mine, in addition to the ore, there are also waste minerals. for example, in copper deposits, the copper element is found in various minerals such as chalcopyrite and a number of other minerals. the grade of copper element in these ores is less than one percent. therefore, ninety-nine percent of the mined ore is waste that must be separated from it."
what is mining or processing?,"the process of separating waste from economically useful minerals is called ore processing (processing) of mineral matter, which is done in factories next to mines."
what is a concentrate?,"the final product (concentrate) is transferred to the smelter for metal separation, either directly or by conversion
it is little used in industry."
write the reasons for human use of gems.,"since ancient times, man has used gems to adorn himself, to use the beauty and stunning features and various effects in these minerals to make himself look more beautiful. this issue goes back to the beautiful nature of friendship and aesthetics that almighty god has embedded in human beings. perhaps this was one of the most important reasons for the creation of gemology and its subsequent developments."
write the number of minerals with gems.,"it should be noted that only among about 4000 known minerals, about 100 minerals have the necessary characteristics of a gem."
write the definition of gem.,"gems or jewels (arabic word) include precious stones and minerals that are distinguished from other minerals and stones due to their beauty, luster, strength, high hardness, color, and rarity, and are of particular interest to people. take"
name the most important gems.,"the beauty of color and brilliance of gems such as ruby, emerald, turquoise and agate, amethyst, attracts everyone's attention."
write the factors of the formation of gems.,"gems are very beautiful and special and rare representatives of the world of minerals that are formed by magmatic, hydrothermal or metamorphic processes."
write the most important properties of gems.,"the most important properties of gems are their hardness, color, and luster. if a gem does not have enough hardness, it is not resistant to scratches and will be destroyed. some other properties, such as play of color, give minerals luster and beauty."
write the characteristics of the mineral chrysoberyl.,like the mineral chrysoberyl (cat's eye) with an opal glow and a type of silica gem called opal that has an iridescent glow.
"write the color, chemical composition and how the diamond is formed.","a colorless gem with a pure carbon composition, which is formed under very high pressure in the earth's mantle."
write the uses of diamond.,"in addition to gem use, it is also used in abrasives."

write the characteristics of garnet.,"garnet is a silicate mineral that is usually seen in green, red, yellow, orange, etc. colors. its most famous color is dark red."
write the characteristics of agate.,"agate is quartz with various colors, which is available in the market under different names and cuts. agate is a semi-precious mineral found in many parts of iran."
write down the characteristics of zaburjad.,peridot is a silicate mineral whose scientific name is olivine and is olive green in color.
write the characteristics of turquoise.,turquoise is an ancient gem that was first found in neishabur and exported to other parts of the world. its scientific name is turquoise.
explain the importance of energy sources.,"energy resources are necessary for all human activities, and humans have used natural resources to produce energy from the past to the present day."
write the importance of fossil fuels.,"among the various energy sources available, fossil fuels are very important. in most countries of the world, fossil fuels are the main sources of energy production."
write how fossil fuels are formed.,fossil fuels come from the decomposition of plant and animal organic matter that is stored in sediments or sedimentary rocks.
what is a hydrocarbon?,"are hydrocarbons that exist naturally in the form of liquid, gas and semi-solid in the earth."
crude oil is formed in what environment?,"unlike coal, which is formed in dry environments, crude oil is formed in a shallow marine environment (less than 200 meters)."
explain how crude oil is formed.,"in these environments, organisms such as plankton and bacteria are the most important sources of organic matter. after death, the remains of these organisms are buried in the fine-grained sediments of the seabed. the remaining organic matter is covered by the upper layers and is layer by layer. sediments are the source rock (mother rock) of oil. organic matter is converted into crude oil through a series of chemical reactions during the conversion of fine-grained sediment to parent rock. in the process of forming oil reserves, the amount of temperature and pressure, and its increase, is very important. but this is not the end of the story."
how is the initial migration of oil done?,"the oil and gas formed in the parent rock, together with the seawater that has been trapped in the rock since deposition, moves upward through the rock porosity, which is called primary oil migration."
how is the secondary migration of oil done?,"during this migration, oil, gas, and water reach high-permeability rocks, such as sandstone and limestone, and fill their voids and voids. because oil and gas are lighter than water, they are separated from water and placed on top of it, which is called secondary migration."
explain the origin of oil springs and natural bitumen deposits.,"if there is no obstacle in their path, they reach the surface of the earth and create oil wells. in this case, they may evaporate on the surface of the earth, or sometimes this oil undergoes oxidation and thickens and creates natural bitumen reserves, many of which are found in khuzestan and ilam provinces."
write oil traps and their roles.,"if oil and gas reach layers of impermeable rocks such as shale and chalk during their migration, they will no longer be able to continue migrating. these impermeable layers or oil traps prevent the movement of oil and gas to the surface of the earth and trap them in the reservoir rock. oil and gas are extracted by drilling deep wells in the reservoir rock. it is said that 99.9% of the oil that has been produced throughout the history of the earth has reached the earth's surface and has been lost, and 0.1% of it has formed all the existing oil reserves."
what is coal?,coal is a solid fossil fuel that is formed from organic matter in terrestrial environments.
explain how coal is formed.,"these organic materials are mostly obtained from trees, bushes and meadows. they accumulate in swamps and are covered by sediments and over time turn into peat, which is a type of peat. in some countries, such as ireland, peat is used as a fuel."
write the stages of coal formation.,"over millions of years, the peat becomes more compact under the pressure of sediments and rocks above, and water and volatile substances such as carbon dioxide and methane are released from it. with the removal of these materials, finally, the thickness of peat, which is a hollow and porous material, decreases and turns into lignite. as the density increases, lignite turns into higher quality coal called bitumen and then anthracite."
write the most important changes in the charring process from peat to anthracite.,"in the process of coaling from peat to anthracite, many changes occur, and with the gradual removal of water and volatile substances, the percentage of carbon in the resulting rock increases, and the quality and power of coal energy production improves."
write the importance of water.,"astronauts have described the earth as a blue and very beautiful planet. water in its solid, liquid and gaseous states causes vast changes in the surface layer and around the earth. water is a symbol of life and in an endless journey between the rocks and the atmosphere causes changes in the earth's crust, erosion, climate changes, etc."
name the water resources of the planet.,human life and other living things are not possible without water. the required water is provided from surface and underground water sources. atmospheric rains play an essential role in providing these resources.
explain the water cycle.,"a part of the rains in a catchment area, before reaching the earth's surface, is captured by the leaves of the plants and produces rainwater, some of which evaporates and returns to the air again. it reaches the surface of the earth, or evaporates, or flows as runoff towards the lower areas of the basin. a part of the runoff seeps into the ground and feeds underground water sources. the majority of the underground water finally reaches the surface of the earth through a spring, well or aqueduct."
write the importance of running water.,"running water, although it is very small compared to the total volume of water in korea, but it is very important in the changes of the earth's surface and the formation of water resources such as drinking water, agriculture, industry, electricity production, etc."
what is hydration and how is it calculated?,"the speed of water varies in different parts of a river. the measurement of water speed and river flow is done on a daily basis or in longer periods of time and in different ways. by determining the speed of water in a river or canal and measuring its cross-sectional area, it is possible to calculate the flow rate using the following equation.
q: flow in cubic meters per second
a: area of ​​water flow cross-section in square meters
v: water flow velocity in meters per second
q=a×v"
compare the flow rate of rivers in summer and winter.,"the water level of the river increases in the spring due to the melting of snow and increased rainfall. then, during the summer, the flow of the river usually decreases."
why are rivers permanent in wet areas?,"in humid regions, where rainfall is high and evaporation is low, rivers are permanent. in these rivers, the part of the water that always flows forms the base watershed. the water of these rivers, when there is no rain, is provided by the melting of snow and ice in the high areas or by the entry of underground water into them."
why are rivers seasonal and temporary in hot and dry areas?,"in hot and dry regions where rainfall is low and evaporation is high, most rivers are temporary and seasonal."
write the definition of groundwater.,"underground water is water that collects in the pores and empty spaces of the underground layers and can be exploited through wells, springs and aqueducts."
write the importance of underground water.,"usable underground water, although it is only a small amount of water in korea, but this amount is the largest reserve of fresh water that can be used on land."
what is a ventilation zone? explain,"when water penetrates into the ground, a part of the infiltrated water sticks to the surface of the soil or rock particles, so that the pores and empty spaces are filled by water and the ventilation zone is formed."
what is the saturation zone? explain,part of the infiltrated water moves deeper to reach the bedrock and collect on it and create the saturated zone. that the empty spaces are filled with water. the upper level of this area is the water level.
what is the depth of the water level?,the depth of the water table is different in different regions. in some areas it is less than one meter and in some areas it reaches hundreds of meters.
what is the role of underground water in creating springs and ponds? explain,"the water level almost follows the topography of the earth's surface. when the aquifer meets the surface of the earth, the underground water appears as a spring or pond on the surface of the earth."
write the role of underground water in creating swamps and salt marshes.,"and if the surface of the reservoir coincides with the surface of the earth or is located near it, a swamp or salt marsh is formed."
aquifer formation factor:,"to form an aquifer, it is necessary that sediments and rocks have empty spaces."
write the causes of empty spaces.,"these are empty spaces or primary pores that have existed in them since the beginning of their formation, or they have been formed after the formation of the stone as a result of fracture, weathering, dissolution or other factors."
write the formula for the percentage of empty spaces (porosity).,the percentage of empty spaces (porosity) of sediment or rock is calculated according to the following relationship in terms of percentage.
does soil porosity mean permeability and water passage?,"the higher the percentage of porosity of the soil or rock, the more water it can hold. but it does not necessarily cause water to pass through. for example, the foot stone is very porous, but water does not pass through it."
why do clays have low permeability?,"clays are very porous, but due to the small size of the particles, they have very little permeability."
what are the factors affecting the permeability of soil and sediments?,the degree of permeability of the soil depends on the degree of communication and the size of the pores. some soils have high porosity and low permeability and it is difficult for water to pass through them.
what does the percentage of porosity and permeability of aquifer indicate?,the porosity percentage of the aquifer indicates the amount of water stored in it and the permeability indicates the ability of the aquifer to conduct water.
write the different characteristics of alluvium and rocks in the formation of aquifer.,"different rocks and sediments have different characteristics in terms of formation of aquifer and amount of drainage.
- alluviums and porous limestones (karst limestone) have the ability to form aquifers
-shales, metamorphic and igneous rocks do not form a good aquifer, so usually either springs do not form in them, or if they do, they have very low and seasonal springs.
- in porous limestones, springs full of water and permanent are usually created."
define piezometric level.,"if a well is drilled in a free aquifer, the water level in the well represents the hydrostatic level, and in the pressurized aquifer, it represents the piezometric level."
write the characteristics of groundwater movement.,"water needs energy to move through the earth.
groundwater generally moves from a place with more energy to a place with less energy.
this movement is much slower than the movement of water in the river.

what law is used to calculate the velocity of underground water?,darcy's law is used to calculate the velocity of underground water.
write the most important compounds of underground water.,"the composition of groundwater varies from place to place. groundwater mainly contains chlorides, sulfates and bicarbonates of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and iron. many other elements and materials are also present in very small amounts in underground water."
write the factors affecting the concentration of dissolved salts in groundwater.,"the concentration of salts dissolved in underground water depends on the type of minerals and rocks, the speed of water penetration, temperature and the distance traveled by water. while the water moves slowly underground, it has a lot of opportunity to dissolve the minerals on its way."
what is the amount of dissolved salts in underground water in rocks and sediments?,"- the amount of soluble salts in underground water in igneous and metamorphic rocks is usually low.
- evaporative rocks such as salt rock and gypsum rock have high solubility, and therefore, the water of these types of aquifers generally has a lot of salts.
- aqueous layers in river and alluvial sediments usually contain fresh water.
- in dry areas, such as the desert areas of iran, in some places the salinity of water is so high that it is unsuitable for many uses."
name and explain the types of water in water resources management.,"in water resources management, water reserves are divided into renewable and non-renewable categories.
renewable water: renewable water is water that is replaced in a certain time scale, after human consumption, through the water cycle.
non-renewable water: the part of water reserves that cannot be replaced after consumption is non-renewable water."
write the method to prevent water crisis.,"in order to prevent water crisis, the amount of exploitation of water resources should be lower than the amount of feeding of those resources. failure to comply with this in the past years has led to a sharp decrease in the underground water reserves of our country. therefore, it is very important and vital to pay attention to the consumption of water resources in the country. today, in some water-scarce countries, exploitation of fossil waters has been proposed."
define fossil waters.,fossil waters are waters that have been trapped at great depths for the past several thousand years and are not in the water cycle.
write the reason for calculating the water balance.,"calculating the water balance of an aquifer is, in many ways, similar to checking the cost balance of a family or any economic unit, which helps to compare income and expenses. in the management and exploitation of water resources, in order to determine the fluctuations in the volume of water resources of a region, balance
water is calculated."
write the formula for calculating the water balance.,"water balance is based on the principle of conservation of mass. the following relationship exists between the amount of water entering the aquifer (i) and the water leaving it (o) and the changes that occur in the volume of water storage (δs).
i – o = δs"
define positive and negative balance.,"in other words, the changes that occur in the volume of water inside the aquifer are equal to the difference between the incoming and outgoing water. if the amount of water entering the aquifer is greater than the amount of outgoing water, the balance is positive, and if it is less than that, the balance is negative."
write down the reasons for the negative balance of the country's water resources.,"during the past years, due to the high exploitation of water resources, the balance of water resources in the whole country and in most of the country's 609 plains has been negative. based on this, many plains of the country have been declared as forbidden plains in terms of the development of underground water exploitation."

land subsidence is observed in which plains?,"this situation is observed in many plains of our country, which are facing a negative balance of underground water."
write the types of land subsidence.,"land subsidence is either created quickly, in the form of a sinkhole, or slowly and imperceptibly, in the form of subsidence of a large area and the creation of cracks and fissures on the surface of the earth."
write the consequences of land subsidence.,"in order to reduce the amount of land subsidence, the use of underground water sources should be reduced and the aquifers should be artificially fed."
the quality of underground water depends on what factors?,"the quality of underground water depends on its chemical composition and the amount of dissolved substances in it. in addition to water salts, some pollution is introduced by humans."
explain point and non-point sources of groundwater pollution.,"groundwater pollutant sources are point or non-point. in the point case, polluting substances directly enter the groundwater from a specific point, such as a sewage well (absorption well).
in the non-point state, polluting substances penetrate the ground through contaminated runoff from the surface of pastures, forests, or agricultural lands and enter the groundwater."
what factors threaten the quality and quantity of underground water?,"the quality of underground water resources is threatened by agricultural fertilizers, industrial and urban wastes, as well as their quantity through high exploitation."
what are qualitative and quantitative boundaries and protection of underground water resources?,"therefore, protecting these resources is very important. one of the methods of protecting underground water sources is to determine the boundaries for them. based on this, quantitative and qualitative privacy is defined."

write the factors affecting the amount of soil compounds.,"of course, the composition of soils varies and depends on factors such as the type of parent rock, the slope of the land, the activity of organisms and the climate of the region."
name the three types of soil particles.,"the particles that make up the soil, according to their size, are divided into three main categories of coarse grains (sandy soils).
medium grain (sand and silt) and fine grain (clay soils) are divided. usually, natural soils are a combination of them."
explain the relationship between soil water content and soil particle size.,"the amount of water that soils can hold depends on the size of the soil particles. the smaller the soil particles, the more water it holds."
why is clay not suitable for growing plants?,"clay is very fine-grained, so the space between its particles is very small, so that water and air circulation does not take place well, and it is not suitable for the growth of plants."
why are sandy soils not suitable for growing plants?,"in sandy soils, water easily passes through the particles, that is, it has good drainage, but it is not suitable for the growth of plants, because it does not retain water and nutrients."
what is loam soil?,"in general, loam soil, which is a combination of sand and clay, is the favorite soil of farmers and gardeners."
write the definition of soil profile.,"the vertical section of the soil from the ground surface to the bedrock, where different soil horizons can be seen, is called the soil profile. usually, there are the following horizons in the soil profile. ."
write the characteristics of horizon a.,horizon a is the highest soil layer. the roots of plants are located in it. this horizon usually contains vegetation along with sand and clay. the presence of organic matter causes the gray to black color of this horizon.
write the characteristics of horizon b.,"horizon b or middle soil, usually consists of clay, sand, gravel and a small amount of plants."
write the properties of horizon c.,"c horizon is the soil below and in it, stone materials have been destroyed and decomposed to a small extent, as a result, the original stone has not changed much and is broken into pieces. under this horizon, there is bedrock that has not been destroyed or decomposed."
in what ways are the soils of different regions different from each other?,"although these horizons are observed in many soil profiles, the soils of different regions are different in terms of color, texture, thickness and chemical composition."
what soils are valuable for agriculture and industry?,the soil resulting from the degradation of silicates and phosphate rocks is of great agricultural and industrial value.
what soils have no agricultural value?,"if the soils resulting from the destruction of rocks with resistant minerals (such as quartz), which are often sandy, have no agricultural value."
write the definition of fertile soil in agriculture.,"in agriculture, a soil that causes more plant growth is called fertile."

write the definition of soil erosion.,erosion is a continuous process in which soil particles are separated from their original substrate and transported to another place with the help of transport agents.
can human activities stop erosion altogether?,"human activities reduce or increase it but cannot stop it completely. the amount of soil erodibility, usually in different days of the year, is not constant."
write a comparison of erosion performance by natural and human factors.,"erosion is carried out naturally and by factors such as running water, wind, glacier, gravity and underground water without human intervention and slowly or at high speed.
human activities such as agriculture, mining, road construction and other construction activities intensify natural erosion. in addition to humans, other organisms also play a role in increasing these erosions."
explain the role of rainfall intensity and duration in soil erosion.,"the most important feature of rainfall that is effective in its erosive power is the intensity and duration of rainfall. usually, the more intense the rain, the bigger the raindrops."
explain the role of raindrops in soil erosion.,"the large size of the raindrops increases the mass and speed of the falling drops, which, as a result, leads to greater kinetic energy and erosive power."
"write trench erosion, its causes and consequences.","when the water flow becomes intense, it causes ditch erosion and loss of valuable agricultural lands. the creation of ditches, in addition to reducing the value of agricultural land, causes the destruction of roads, bridges and buildings."
write the ways to reduce the kinetic energy of water and reduce water erosion of the soil.,"in most situations, it is possible to reduce the energy of water flow by building a channel and creating vegetation."
write the effective factors in the erosion rate of runoff.,"the erosive power of runoff depends on the speed and depth of the flow, and the amount of suspended material in the runoff. the higher the speed of the runoff and its depth, the higher the kinetic energy of the water, and as a result, its erosive power. the erosion power of pure water is less than that of water with suspended matter."
when does sedimentation of suspended matter by runoff begin?,"when the amount of suspended solids is greater than the carrying capacity of the runoff, sedimentation begins."
write the consequences of soil erosion.,"soil erosion reduces the cultivated area and reduces the fertility of the land.
also, with the sedimentation of materials in waterways and reservoirs of dams and the reduction of their water intake capacity, damages
it creates abundance."
why are water and soil valuable assets of the country?,water and soil are very important for every country as valuable assets because water and soil are essential factors for plant growth and increase of agricultural and forest products.
what is the importance of soil protection?,soil protection has a great effect in preventing air pollution and soil erosion.
what is the purpose of soil protection?,the purpose of soil protection is to prevent gradual soil degradation.
when will the gradual soil degradation be prevented?,this goal is achieved when the rate of soil erosion is lower than the rate of its formation
explain the relationship between man-made structures and the earth.,"since the distant past, man has built buildings that are still standing after thousands of years have passed. the great columns of persepolis, the buildings of chaghazanbil, the egyptian pyramids, the great wall of china and the ancient aqueducts are still standing despite the passage of years and show the peak of engineering knowledge in ancient times. roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, oil, gas and water transmission lines, dams, factories, buildings

write the relationship between the stability of the earth and the construction of structures.,"one of the main issues in the construction and maintenance of structures is the stability of the ground. in the construction of structures, there are various geological issues that must be studied."
explain the role of the geologist in reducing the damage caused by natural hazards to man-made structures.,one of the important duties of a geologist is to detect the possibility of destructive processes and provide methods to deal with them in such a way that there is no damage to civil and mining facilities and structures.
what is the relationship between the structure and the geological studies of their bedrock?,"before implementing construction projects such as dams, power plants, highways, bridges, commercial and residential complexes, towers, etc., which are called structures, it is necessary to conduct geological studies of their bedrock."
write the most important geological studies in locating structures.,"in these studies, the unevenness of the ground surface, the strength of the rocks, the permeability, the stability of the slopes against the fall and the type of materials used in the structure are investigated. the morphology or elevations of the place where the structure is built has a significant effect on its stability."
write the relevance of checking the strength of the foundation in the location of structures.,"when the stone is affected by an external force, a force is applied inside the stone per unit area, which is called stress."
write the types of stress.,"stresses on a rock or soil may be tensile, compressive or shear or a combination of them. the stresses on rocks and soils cause their shape to change."
explain how to check the value of rock and soil resistance against stress.,"in the initial studies of a project, in order to take samples of the soil or foundation stone of the structure, boreholes or narrow and deep holes are dug in different places of the construction site. collect rock or soil samples
is sent to specialized laboratories and the amount of rock and soil resistance against stresses
imported, are examined."
what is rock resistance?,rock strength is the maximum stress or combination of stresses that a rock can withstand without breaking.
explain the relationship between the resistance of rocks and soils to stress.,"the lower the resistance to these stresses, the more unstable the rock is and the more fracture surfaces are created in it."
write the instability factors of rocks and soils followed by the factors.,joints or fractures cause the rock or soil instability of the structures.
write the three types of material behavior before stress and after stress.,"a- elastic behavior: some objects, such as stones, show elastic behavior. this means that by applying stress, the stones undergo a change in shape and when the stress is removed, they return to their original state.
b- fracture: however, if the stress exceeds the rock's resistance, the rock will break and create cracks and faults.
p- plastic or plastic behavior: some stones show plastic behavior, that is, after removing the stress, the deformed stones do not completely return to their original state."
compare the resistance of different types of stones against stress.,"the resistance of all kinds of stones against the applied stress is different. igneous rocks can be a suitable support for structures. like the foundation stone of amirkabir dam, which is made of gabbro rock.
some metamorphic rocks, such as quartzite and hornfels, can be suitable supports for heavy structures.
- some of them, like schists, are loose and weak and are not suitable for foundations of structures.
some sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, have the necessary strength to build a structure.
- evaporative rocks such as gypsum, salt and shales are not resistant to stress."
what are carbonate rocks?,carbonate rocks are sedimentary rocks that are more than 50% carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite). these stones are often jointed.
write how caves are formed in carbonate rocks.,"with the passage of time and in the flow of infiltrating water, parts of these rocks dissolve in the water and form holes in them. the progress of dissolution may lead to the formation of large dissolution holes in these rocks and the creation of caves. ."
which type of limestone is a good support for structures?,"a thick layer of limestone, which does not have dissolution holes, is a good foundation and support for building a structure"
which type of limestone is unsuitable for structures?,"however, if the limestone has dissolution holes, it can cause serious problems such as water leakage or land subsidence."
"if the dam is built on layers of gypsum, what problems will it create?","the solubility of evaporite rocks (gypsum and salt rock) is more than limestone. therefore, cavities and dissolution caves are formed in these rocks faster than other rocks. if the dam is built on layers of gypsum rock, after a few years, dissolution holes may be created in the rock, causing water to escape from the dam reservoir and also the instability of the dam body."
explain the effect of river sediments on the useful capacity of dams.,the sediments that are carried by the rivers to the reservoir of the dams gradually reduce the useful capacity of the reservoir. some of the country's dams have lost a significant part of their efficiency due to accumulation of sediments.
write the types of underground excavations.,some construction and mining activities take place underground. these activities require underground space. underground excavations are in the form of tunnels and caves.

are you mongolian?,"caves are larger underground spaces that are used to create underground facilities such as power plants, subway stations, oil storage, or other things."
describe the role of geologists in locating tunnels and caves.,"such structures should be built on lands with sufficient resistance. therefore, the geologist should focus his studies on identifying areas with the least amount of fragmentation, weathering or water seepage."
explain the important role of estimating and controlling the amount of underground water in the construction of tunnels and caves.,"the presence of underground water affects the safety and stability of surface structures such as dams and underground structures such as tunnels during construction and operation. the flow and pressure of underground water is one of the important factors of instability of tunnels and underground spaces.
a large part of the problems and damages in construction and mining projects have been caused by dealing with underground water, in some cases, projects have not been completed and stopped due to these problems. therefore, the estimation of the amount and control of water flow underground is very important in tunnels, trenches and the ground under the structure and even inside structures like dams."
which tunnels are more stable?,"in general, the tunnels that are placed above the water level have more stability
are"

describe the relationship between the stability of fine-grained soils and moisture content.,"the stability of fine-grained soils depends on their moisture content. the higher the moisture content of fine-grained soils, the lower their stability."
what is the result of increasing humidity in fine-grained soils and the cause of soil slippage in wet months? explain,"if the humidity in these soils exceeds a certain limit, the soil becomes pasty and liquefies under the influence of its own weight. landslides in slopes and trenches, especially in the wet months of the year, are caused by this phenomenon."
write the importance of fine-grained and coarse-grained soils.,"fine-grained and coarse-grained soils are used in many structures, such as the body of earthen dams, road infrastructure, and airport runways."
explain the reasons for the use of soil in the substructure and pavement section of road construction.,"the natural surface of the earth is not suitable for vehicles and it does not have enough resistance against atmospheric factors such as precipitation, temperature changes and the forces coming from the wheels of cars, for this reason soil materials are used in the substructure and pavement sector for the construction of roads. each consists of two parts."
name the two main parts of soil materials in road construction.,"substructure consists of two parts: sub-base and base, and pavement consists of two parts: lining and top.
sub-base section of roads: in the sub-base section, which acts as a drainage layer, a mixture of sand and crushed stone is used.

what is the main cause of earthquake?,"the main cause of earthquakes is the movement of tectonic plates. the rocks that make up the crust show elastic behavior against the incoming force. as the stress exceeds the rock's resistance, the rocks break and the earthquake energy is released from the fracture site in the form of seismic waves."
define the epicenter of an earthquake.,it is a place inside the earth from where stored energy is released.
what is the epicenter of an earthquake?,it is a point on the surface of the earth that is located above the epicenter of the earthquake. this center has the shortest distance from the epicenter of the earthquake
name the types of seismic waves.,internal or primary waves and surface or secondary waves
name and explain the types of internal waves.,"these waves are created in the epicenter of the earthquake and spread inside the earth and include p and s waves. p waves are the fastest, therefore, they are the first waves recorded by the seismograph. these waves pass through solid, liquid and gas environments, the speed of waves in different environments is different. the denser the rocks, the faster the waves travel."
what are secondary waves?,these waves are recorded by seismographs after the p waves. these waves only pass through solid environments
name the types of surface waves.,"these waves are not produced in the focus; rather, they are caused by the collision of internal waves with the interface of layers and the surface of the earth. the most common ones are love (l) and rayleigh (r) waves."
what are love (l) waves?,l waves are the waves that are recorded by seismographs after the s wave.
what are rayleigh waves (r)?,they are the last waves that are recorded by seismographs. the movement of this wave is similar to sea waves
how do earthquake waves propagate and how long does it take to reach a seismograph station?,"earthquake waves propagate to a very long distance from the epicenter. as they continue to propagate at a distance of about 10,000 kilometers from the surface center of the earthquake, after the p wave is registered, it takes about 10 minutes for the s wave to reach this area."
